# SOC Analyst Portfolio

## About Me

Security-focused professional transitioning from 5+ years of supervisory experience in Canada Revenue Agency's contact centre operations to cybersecurity. My background in identity verification, access management (RBAC), compliance oversight (PIPEDA), and incident triage provides a strong foundation for Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) roles.

I bring practical experience in:

- Identity and Access Management (IAM) lifecycle management
- Secure access workflows and privilege management
- Regulatory compliance and audit oversight
- Security awareness training and operational risk assessment
- AI/ML integration and emerging technology risk analysis

Currently pursuing hands-on security operations experience through certifications, virtual labs, and real-world simulations.
